-I had an issue where the numbers would be added to the number bank, but as soon as they
were added, they would disappear and not be saved into the bank.
After some research, I found that what was happening was the form was being submitted or page being reloaded,
so thats why the number would disappear. In order to fix this problem,
I had to use event.PreventDefault() function
in order to prevent the form from submitting or page reloading.
